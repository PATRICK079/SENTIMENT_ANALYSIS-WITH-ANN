# Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of sentiment analysis, covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The focus is on sentiment classification using an artificial neural network (ANN), offering a detailed guide on how to effectively build sentiment analysis models with TensorFlow, along with visualization using TensorBoard. The project aims to leverage Jupyter Notebook to create an ANN and analyze movie reviews from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset, classifying them as either “fresh” (positive) or “rotten” (negative).

# Business Problem

A company struggled with processing and analyzing movie reviews from platforms like Rotten Tomatoes. The manual review of these reviews was time-consuming and inconsistent. Marketing and content strategy teams were overwhelmed, resulting in missed opportunities to identify audience preferences and address critical issues that were affecting viewer satisfaction and content performance. Now, they have employed me to help with creating a robust algorithm that can generalize well to solve their business problem by automatically classifying reviews as positive ("fresh") or negative ("rotten").
